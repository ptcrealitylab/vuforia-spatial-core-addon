# Vuforia Spatial Edge Server Core Add-on

This is the core-addon for the Vuforia Spatial Edge Server. It provides a
baseline set of blocks, interfaces, nodes, and tools to the Edge Server. The
server loads code from blocks, interfaces, and nodes. The editor user interface
loads blocks, nodes, and tools.

The Vuforia Spatial Toolbox and Vuforia Spatial Edge Server make up a shared research platform for exploring spatial computing as a community. This research platform is not an out of the box production-ready enterprise solution. Please read the [MPL 2.0 license](LICENSE) before use.

## Add-on Content Types

### Blocks

Logic blocks available in the data crafting board.

### Interfaces

Hardware interfaces which translate between the hardwareInterface.js API and
the hardware.

### Nodes

Programming nodes associated with an object that can produce and consume
values.

### Tools

Tools which the user can place on objects or float in world space to provide
useful interactions.

### Content Scripts

Low-level scripts placed directly into the user interface's context as if they
were part of the editor's code.


## Examples

This repo contains examples for blocks, interfaces, nodes, and tools. Content
scripts are more niche but a simple "hello world" example looks like this:

```javascript
(function() {
    function initService() {
        let messageDiv = document.createElement('div');
        messageDiv.style.position = 'absolute';
        messageDiv.style.left = 0;
        messageDiv.style.top = 0;
        messageDiv.style.fontFamily = 'sans-serif';
        messageDiv.style.fontSize = '12px';
        messageDiv.style.color = 'cyan';
        messageDiv.style.pointerEvents = 'none';
        messageDiv.textContent = 'Hello world!';

        document.body.appendChild(messageDiv);
    }

    realityEditor.addons.addCallback('init', initService);
}());
```

## Using the Kepware Interface

The Kepware Interface is compatible with both [KEPServerEX](https://www.kepware.com/en-us/products/kepserverex/) and [Kepware Edge](https://www.kepware.com/en-us/products/thingworx-kepware-edge/).
To connect to a server: enable the interface in the Spatial Toolbox Web UI,
enter your user credentials for the Kepware Server in the interface settings,
and add your client certificate to the list of trusted certificates using your
server's configuration tools. The client certificate can be found in
`./node_modules/node-opcua-client/certificates`.
